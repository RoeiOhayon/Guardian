- If wanted, use __new__() inside guard to make the interface be without brackets (guard.none instead guard.none())

- Use wraps (Make API more understandable)
- Maybe Provide onError function? or maybe return from function (Probably a bad idea)
- less_than, more_than
- maybe enable no parentheses
- Make good errors for library
